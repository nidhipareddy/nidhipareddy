## 🚀 Featured Projects

- 🔍 [**TuringBots vs Humans**]  
  Analyzed 1.36 TiB of GitHub Archive data using PySpark to assess the impact of AI coding assistants on developer productivity, commit behaviors, and trends in open-source development.

- 📊 [**Employment Demographics Analysis**]  
  Conducted logistic regression on IPUMS CPS microdata to investigate the effects of nativity, gender, and immigration status on employment probabilities using R and tidyverse tools.

- 🗽 [**NYC Urban Mobility Analytics**]  
  Built a data pipeline on GCP and MySQL to analyze NYC taxi and rideshare data; identified peak usage zones, accessibility gaps, and informed equitable transit planning.

- 📈 [**Gasoline Price Forecasting**]  
  Forecasted gas prices using LSTM, ARIMAX, VAR, and ECM models with <3% MAPE; developed backtested trading strategies using EIA data and time series analysis.
  
- 👩‍💼 [**IBM Employee Attrition Prediction**]  
  Performed employee segmentation using K-Prototypes clustering and developed cluster-specific attrition models using logistic regression, random forest, and gradient boosting. The project aimed to enhance retention strategies by identifying high-risk groups and their key drivers of attrition.
